# Awesome CLI Coding Agents

> A curated list of CLI (command-line interface) AI agents that understand code and can make edits, generate files, and manage coding workflows from the terminal.

## What are CLI Coding Agents?

CLI coding agents are AI-powered tools that run directly in your terminal and can:
- **Understand codebases** - Read and comprehend project structure and existing code
- **Make intelligent edits** - Modify multiple files with context awareness
- **Generate code** - Create new files and complete implementations
- **Manage workflows** - Handle git commits, PRs, and project automation
- **Execute autonomously** - Take action based on natural language instructions
